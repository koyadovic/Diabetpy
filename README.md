diabetpy
========

This project started with the aim to be useful for diabetic people all over the world. The application generates functions based on previous data to recommend future insulin doses. It is being written in Python helping itself by a SQLite database in a curses user interface. Currently you can score more events in addition to meals such as hypoglycemia, blood glucose, for subsequent reports. You can edit the list of foods that will be used on meals and also can modify previous recommendations approximating the functions of breakfast, lunch and dinner for best results.

Current application state deprecated. Now I'm working in a new project where some things from here were implemented, and other were discarded.
